There are 6 data sample in both negative and positive data-set
'prepare.py' is used to replace these 6 data sample (drug_id and sequence 300)

'data_2_vector.py' is used to transfer negative-data-mlp.out
                                       positive-data-mlp.out
                                       files to separate vector(600) files in /positive and /negative folders
                                       under data/pre-process folder.

'mlp_model.py' is the model structure

'5_fold_cross_valid_generator.py' does the training and validation part of model with
                                        cross validation
                                        and data generator
